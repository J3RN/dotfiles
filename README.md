# J3RN's dotfiles

A bunch of my arbitrary sorta-interesting dotfiles

## Requirements

This has been tested on OSX 10.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. I make no guarantees about other systems.

You will need:
- zsh

If other things seems to be required, please open an issue and I will address that.

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh
```
